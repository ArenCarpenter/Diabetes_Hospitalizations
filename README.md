## Introduction

Diabetes affects 30 million Americans, that's almost 10% of the population, as of 2015. It is a family of diseases that affects how your body can utilize blood sugar (specifically, glucose). While vital for powering your cells, a buildup of glucose in the blood can lead to serious health problems. Type I diabetes usually emerges pre-adolescence and is characterized by one's immune system incorrectly targeting insulin-producing cells. Type II can emerge at any age and is characterized by cells becoming resistent to insulin binding. This keeps glucose from being transported into the cells and causes a buildup of glucose in the blood. 

There are a plethora of factors that impact diabetes, including genetics and environmental factors. Family history is the driving factor for Type I diabetes. For Type II diabetes, in addition to family history, there are many more environmental factors, such as weight, inactivity, age, race, and other underlying health concerns.
